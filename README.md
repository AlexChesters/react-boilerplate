# react-redux-bootstrap-boilerplate

A reasonably bare boilerplate that gets you set up with
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and
[Redux](http://redux.js.org/).
The boilerplate also includes support for unit tests
(using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/))
and snapshot tests (using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html)).
[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) is used for bundling.

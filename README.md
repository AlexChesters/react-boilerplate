# react-redux-bootstrap-boilerplate

A reasonably bare boilerplate that gets you set up with
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/),
[Redux](http://redux.js.org/) and
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
The boilerplate also includes support for unit tests
(using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/))
and component tests (using [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/)).
[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) is used for bundling.

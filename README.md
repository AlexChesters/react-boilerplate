# react-boilerplate

A reasonably bare boilerplate that gets you set up with
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).
The boilerplate also includes support for unit tests
(using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/)).
[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) is used for bundling.

# Usage instructions

1. `git clone git@github.com:AlexChesters/react-boilerplate.git my-new-app`
1. `cd my-new-app`
1. `./scripts/clean my-new-app`

After this you will be ready to go!
